# Serenity
A Calendar Phone Lock App

## Motivation
In the wake of the digital revolution, every aspect of our lives have become so closely integrated with technology that sensory overload has become the norm. There are too many things going on for all of us on our electronic devices that, without extraordinary self-control, it is difficult for us to focus on a singular task.
It is, perhaps, too common for us to find ourselves scrolling through Instagram for two hours when we were supposed to be completing our homework. As a result of our unproductivity, we find ourselves staying up ungodly hours to rush through our assignments, thus compromising on sleeping time. Not only is time wasted that could be spent on something more meaningful, unhealthy habits are also detrimental to our health. Obviously, none of us want this to happen, but the fact remains that our devices are getting more addictive, and we are finding it harder and harder to stay away.

## Aim
We hope to help people who want to curtail their mobile phone usage be productive and stay focused, through a mobile application with a device-lock function.

## Description
The mobile application provides a device-lock function that, when activated, locks the userâ€™s device for the specified duration. The user is discouraged from unlocking their phone, or accessing any of their mobile applications during this duration. In any case where the user needs to unlock their phone, they can still do so.
