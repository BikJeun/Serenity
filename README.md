# Serenity
A Calendar Phone Lock App

## Motivation
In the wake of the digital revolution, every aspect of our lives have become so closely integrated with technology that sensory overload has become the norm. There are too many things going on for all of us on our electronic devices that, without extraordinary self-control, it is difficult for us to focus on a singular task.
It is, perhaps, too common for us to find ourselves scrolling through Instagram for two hours when we were supposed to be completing our homework. As a result of our unproductivity, we find ourselves staying up ungodly hours to rush through our assignments, thus compromising on sleeping time. Not only is time wasted that could be spent on something more meaningful, unhealthy habits are also detrimental to our health. Obviously, none of us want this to happen, but the fact remains that our devices are getting more addictive, and we are finding it harder and harder to stay away.

## Aim
We hope to help people who want to curtail their mobile phone usage be productive and stay focused, through a mobile application with a device-lock function.

## Description
The mobile application provides a device-lock function that, when activated, locks the user’s device for the specified duration. The user is discouraged from unlocking their phone, or accessing any of their mobile applications during this duration. In any case where the user needs to unlock their phone, they can still do so.

## Features
![General](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69560700/99875791-3e947800-2c2d-11eb-9bed-44013f82d528.png)
1) Calendar

Users can schedule events and reminders, and organise their events by colour tags. The addition of events and reminders will be synced with the Firebase backend. 
Users can also indicate if an event has occurred or been completed. Incompleted events will be shown with a red triangle mark at the left corner.

2) To-Do List

To do so, users can click the ‘+’ button to create a new task. The addition of tasks will be synced with the Firebase backend.
When users want to carry out the task, they can swipe right on the task, which will activate the device lock.
Deletion of tasks is easily done by swiping left on the task. The deletion will be synced on Firebase as well.

3) Device Lock

After users swipe right to begin a task, they are brought to this screen. Upon clicking the ‘LOCK’ button, the device-lock function will be activated for a specified duration. 
Under this feature, the navigation bar on the smartphone (‘back’, ‘home’ and ‘recents’ buttons) will not be accessible. Volume buttons can still be pressed.
Users can only access the ‘UNLOCK’ button, if they wish to end their task prematurely.

4) Settings
